Execution Context (Global)

- Accessible to anything and everywhere in the code 
- Creates two things by the JS engine: 
	1. Global Object 
	2. 'this'
	3. Your code
	4. Outer Environment
	
	Therefore you can use these 
	
	"this" --> window : window is the value (object)
	window is the global object in the browser 
	** there will always be a global object

var a = "hello, world"; 

function b() {

}

**When you create variables and functions outside a function, 
  they become attached to the global object 

window.a; // hello, world
window.b;
